```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd snake-ai-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Snake AI game, execute the following command:
```
python -m src
```

The game will start, and the AI will begin making decisions based on its training.

## Overview
