### 🔒 Security Integration

✅ **Preserved and Enhanced Security Scanning**
- Moved security tools to `tools/security/`
- Created unified CLI: `python tools/security_tools.py`
- Organized configuration in `config/security_scan.ini`
- Added to requirements structure
- Integrated into `pyproject.toml`

### 📦 Modern Python Packaging

✅ **Created `pyproject.toml`**
- Modern Python packaging standard
- Optional dependencies for dev, security, docs
- Entry points for CLI tools
- Tool configuration (black, pytest, bandit)

✅ **Organized Requirements**
- `requirements/base.txt` - Core dependencies
- `requirements/dev.txt` - Development tools
- `requirements/security.txt` - Security scanning
- Maintained backward compatibility with `requirements.txt`

### 🛠️ Developer Experience

✅ **Enhanced Documentation**
- Updated README with new structure
- Added installation options
- Security scanning instructions
- Quick reference commands

✅ **Development Tools**
- Organized in `tools/` directory
- Security scanning CLI
- Project structure viewer
- Cleanup utilities

### 🧪 Testing Structure

✅ **Prepared Test Framework**
- Created `tests/` directory
- Configured pytest in `pyproject.toml`
- Ready for comprehensive test suite

### 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Standard Compliance** - Follows Python packaging standards
2. **Security Integration** - Preserved and enhanced security tools
3. **Modern Tooling** - Uses `pyproject.toml` and modern packaging
4. **Better Organization** - Clear separation of concerns
5. **Developer Friendly** - Easy installation and usage
6. **Maintainability** - Structured for growth and maintenance

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install PyYAML (required dependency)
pip install PyYAML

# Install the project
pip install -e .

# With development tools
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run security scan
python tools/security_tools.py

# Show project structure
python show_structure.py

# Run the application
python -m src
```

### ✅ Fixed Configuration Issues

✅ **Updated Configuration Paths**
- Fixed `__main__.py` to look for `config/config.yaml`
- Fixed `project_manager.py` configuration loading
- Updated strategy configs to use `config/strategies/` directory
- Added missing `advanced_config.yaml`
- Added PyYAML to all requirements files

✅ **Verified Working Application**
- Application starts successfully
- Configurations load from correct locations
- All strategy configs available
- CUDA device detection working

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Populate Tests** - Add comprehensive test suite to `tests/`
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Set up automated testing and security scans
3. **Documentation** - Expand documentation in `docs/`
4. **Code Quality** - Run formatters and linters
5. **Security Schedule** - Set up regular security scanning

The project is now well-organized, secure, and follows Python best practices! 🎉
